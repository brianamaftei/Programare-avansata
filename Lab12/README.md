# AdvancedProgramming - Lab 12

## Compulsory

----

- [x] The input will be a .class file, located anywhere in the file system.
- [x] Load the specified class in memory, identifying dynamically its package.
- [x] Using reflection, extract as many information about the class (at least its methods).
- [x] Using reflection, invoke the static methods, with no arguments, annotated with @Test.

-----------

## Homework


- [x] The input may be a folder (containing .class files) or a .jar. You must explore it recursively.
- [x] Create the complete prototype, in the same manner as javap tool.
- [x] Identify all public classes annotated with @Test and invoke the methods annotated with @Test, whether static or not.
- [x] If a method requires primitive (at least int) or String arguments, generate mock values for them.
- [x] Print a statistics regarding the tests.

---------


## Bonus
- [x] Consider the case when the input files are .java files and compile the source code before analyzing them. (use Java Compiler, for example).
