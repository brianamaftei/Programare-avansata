# AdvancedProgramming - Lab 4

## Compulsory

-------

- [x] Create a Maven project.
- [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Students and projects have names. Make sure the objects of these classes are comparable.
- [x] Create the students and the projects described in the example. Use streams in order to easily create the objects.
- [x] Put all the students in a LinkedList and print them sorted by their names.
- [x] Put all the projects in a TreeSet and print them sorted by their names.

------

## Homework

-------

- [x] Create a class that describes the problem.
- [x] Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the students that have a number of preferences lower than the average number of preferences.
- [x] Use [a third-party library](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) in order to generate random fake names for students and projects. 
- [x] Create a Greedy algorithm in order to solve the problem.

-------

## Bonus

-------

- [x] Implement an algorithm that determines the maximum cardinality matching ... or you may use the following libraries in order to solve it: [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/), [Graph4J](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/graph4j/)
- [ ] Create a random problem generator (with thousands of objects) and test the performance of the implementation (try both libraries). Compare the results with the ones obtained by the greedy algorithm.
- [ ] Determine a minimum cardinality set formed of students and projects with the property that each admissible pair (student-project) contains at least an element of this set.
- [ ] Determine a maximum cardinality set of of students and projects such that there is no admissible pair (student-project) formed with elements of this set.
